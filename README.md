This is my portfolio website, a static React site with mostly custom CSS and a few Ant Design components. I started with create-react-app, but I quickly 'ejected' so I could have more control over the config.

Check out the live site: [https://paulhoskinson.surge.sh/](https://paulhoskinson.surge.sh/)

To run the site locally (i.e. for development or to examine the source code):
- Clone repository to your local computer (this will create a "portfolio" directory): `git clone https://github.com/plhosk/portfolio.git`
- Enter project directory: `cd portfolio`
- Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
- To start dev server with hot reloading: `npm run start` then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser
- To generate an optimized development build: `npm run build`
